R Programming Language

Introduction: 
R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. 

The R environment:
R is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes
--> an effective data handling and storage facility,
--> a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,
--> a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,
    graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and
--> a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and       input and output facilities.

Installation:
There are various CRAN available on the official R website at: https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html depending on your country.

After selecting a particular CRAN, you are directed to the respective download page. In my case, since I selected India, i was directed to https://ftp.iitm.ac.in/cran/

Here, you will easily find informationon how to install R. 

--> For Windows and MAC:
    Precompiled binary distributions of the base system and contributed packages, Windows and Mac users most likely want one of these         versions of R.
--> For Linux 
    R is part of many Linux distributions, you should check with your Linux package management system in addition to the link above.
    
I am going to detail out the procedure for Windows as I am using this OS, specificaly Windows 7 Home Basic. On this same page (https://ftp.iitm.ac.in/cran/), I proceeded to download R 3.2.1
You can download the latest realease R 3.3.1 for Windows (70 megabytes, 32/64 bit).

Next, install the R by simple Setup Wizard downloaded from this link.

Open up the RGui. 

There is a console being shown. You can either execute "Hello World!" here, or make another script with the name helloworld.r and then execute it.

I clicked on File > New Script 
A window opens. 
Type "Hello, World!"
Save the script as helloworld.r

You can the open up this script anytime from File > Open Script
Place the script window and Console window side by side (Windows > Tile Vertically)
Now place your cursor at the end of the statement you want to execute. Press Ctrl + R
Voila, the console outputs the result as:
> "Hello, World!"
[1] "Hello, World!"

Have fun!
Cheers to open source :)
