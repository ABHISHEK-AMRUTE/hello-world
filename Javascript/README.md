# Installing / Running Javascript

### Notes:
- Javascript typically runs in a web browser, which is required to execute JS code. In the last few years it has become possible to run Javascript code outside of the web browser with Node.js.
- This installation guide will focus on running Javascript inside of a browser though for ease of use.

### Installing Chrome:

1. Visit this link: [https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html)
2. Select "Download Chrome", accept the license agreement, and follow the installation instructions after download.

### Running the Javascript Code:

1. Javascript code can be executed either inside of an .html file, or directly in a web browser's console. Here we will focus on the console.
2. To open the console, make sure you are inside of Chrome, and then press Ctrl + Shift + J (Windows / Linux) or Cmd + Opt + J (Mac).
3. In the console, copy and paste the code from hello-world.js and press enter.
