## Programming in B

### Installing B compiler
* Linux/Mac/Windows: Install [Yasha's B Compiler](https://github.com/Leushenko/ybc) by visiting the Github page and either downloading and compiling the source or downloading an existing build.

### Compiling B Code
After downloading a compiler and writing a hello-world.b file, you can compile your B code by executing the following command:
```bash
./ybc hello-world.b  
```

### Executing B Code
Similar to the gcc compiler, ybc creates an executable in the current directory called `a.out`. To run your newly created executable, simply use this command:
```bash
./a.out
```
