## Pascal

### Installing the Pascal compiler

There are several Pascal compilers available for general use. Among these are Turbo Pascal, Delphi, GNU Pascal, Free Pascal, and others.

Free Pascal is a free compiler for running Pascal programs on Linux, Windows, Mac OSX, DOS, FreeBSD, and many other platforms. You can download it from [this link](http://www.freepascal.org/download.var) and follow the installation instructions for your OS.

### Building and running Pascal code
To compile your program, go to `Compile > Compile` or press `Alt + F9`. Then, to run it, go to `Run > Run` or use `Ctrl/Cmd + F9`.

Congrats! You have just run your first Pascal code! :smile:
