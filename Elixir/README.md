# Getting Started

### Linux

## Check if Elixir command line interpreter is installed on your system
- If Elixir command line interpreter is installed, it should display the path as following on terminal
```
$ whereis iex
iex: /usr/local/bin/iex
```

## Installing Elixir Compiler
- Type the following on the command line (For ubuntu like systems).
```
$ sudo apt-get install elixir
```

## Running "Hello World"
- Navigate to the directory containing `hello_world.ex` (you can do this from the terminal or command line using the `cd` command).
- Type in the following
```
$ iex hello_world.ex
iex> HelloModule.hello
Hello World
:ok
```
