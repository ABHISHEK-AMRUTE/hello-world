## Getting Started

Befunge is an esoteric language created in 1993 by Chris Pressey. It is stack based, two-dimensional, and turing-complete.  
  
### Commands

- \+ Addition: Pop two values a and b, then push the result of a+b
- \- Subtraction: Pop two values a and b, then push the result of b-a
- \* Multiplication: Pop two values a and b, then push the result of a*b
- / Integer division: Pop two values a and b, then push the result of b/a, rounded down. According to the specifications, if a is zero, ask the user what result they want.
- % Modulo: Pop two values a and b, then push the remainder of the integer division of b/a.
- ! Logical NOT: Pop a value. If the value is zero, push 1; otherwise, push zero.
- ` Greater than: Pop two values a and b, then push 1 if b>a, otherwise zero.
- < PC direction right
- \> PC direction left
- ^ PC direction up
- v PC direction down
- ? Random PC direction
- _ Horizontal IF: pop a value; set direction to right if value=0, set to left otherwise
- | Vertical IF: pop a value; set direction to down if value=0, set to up otherwise
- " Toggle stringmode (push each character's ASCII value all the way up to the next <code>"</code>)
- : Duplicate top stack value
- \ Swap top stack values
- $ Pop (remove) top stack value and discard
- . Pop top of stack and output as integer
- , Pop top of stack and output as ASCII character
- \# Bridge: jump over next command in the current direction of the current PC
- g A "get" call (a way to retrieve data in storage). Pop two values y and x, then push the ASCII value of the character at that position in the program. If (x,y) is out of bounds, push 0
- p A "put" call (a way to store a value for later use). Pop three values y, x and v, then change the character at the position (x,y) in the program to the character with ASCII value v
- & Get integer from user and push it
- ~ Get character from user and push it
- @ End program
- 0â€“9 Push corresponding number onto the stack
  

### Geting an Interpreter and Running Your Code

As Befunge is an esoteric programming language the best place to write and execute your toy programs is in an online interpreter. There are a number to be found online, but a good one can be found [here](http://www.quirkster.com/iano/js/befunge.html).

It is important to remember that unlike most other languages, the program counter moves around the code space in two dimensions starting at the top left, moving right and following any directional symbols after that. In Befunge it is useful to physically separate different parts of a program to keep organized. However, the most compact programs may have the PC run over the same parts of the code in different directions to utilize it in various ways.
