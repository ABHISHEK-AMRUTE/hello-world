# Processing

## Getting Started

Processing is available for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.
Go to [Processing download page](https://processing.org/download/) and download the newest Processing version.

## Windows

### Installing Processing

Extract the contents of the downloaded zip-File. Now you should have a folder called `processing-x.x.x`.
Move this folder into any directory you want (I prefer to keep it in my Program Files).

### Running "Hello World"

Just execute Processing.exe or double-click the Processing icon to start.
Now go to `File > Open` to open the hello_world.pde file. Then just hit the little run button (tiny triangle inside) on the upper left corner.

**Congratulations! You've run your first Processing program on windows!**

## Linux

### Installing Processing

Extract the contents of the downloaded tar.gz file with `tar tar xvfz processing-x.x.x.tgz`. This will create a directory called `processing-x.x.x`.

### Running "Hello World"

Then switch into the created directory `cd processing-x.x.x` and run `./processing`.
Now go to `File > Open` to open the hello_world.pde file. Then just hit the little run button (tiny triangle inside) on the upper left corner.

**Congratulations! You've run your first Processing program on linux!**

## Mac OS X

### Installing Processing

Extract the downloaded zip-File and drag the Processing icon to the Applications folder.

### Running "Hello World"

Just double-click the Processing icon to start.
Now go to `File > Open` to open the hello_world.pde file. Then just hit the little run button (tiny triangle inside) on the upper left corner.

**Congratulations! You've run your first Processing program on MacOS!**
