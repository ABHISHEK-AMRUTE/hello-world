# Getting Started

## Mac OS X
Installing Idris is simple if you have [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed; simply run `brew install idris` from the command line.

## Windows/Linux (or no Homebrew)
You can download Idris from the [downloads](https://www.idris-lang.org/download/) page of the [Idris website](https://www.idris-lang.org/download/).

## Running "Hello World"
From the directory containing `hello.idr`, compile the program by running `idris hello.idr -o hello`. It should take a few seconds. Now you've got an executable. Run `./hello` to see the output.

**Congratulations! You've run your first Idris program!**
