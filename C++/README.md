##Installation 

###Linux 

Linux already has GNU C++ compiler `g++` for compiling C++ files. So need for any external softwares here. 

##Running 

###Linux

1.open terminal
2. cd into the folder that contains the `hello-world.cpp` file
3. type `g++ hello-world.cpp`
4. run the object file output by g++ by running `./a.out`

What happens here is, `g++` takes in the human-readable C++ file and output a machine readable object code file called `a.out`. Then you need to execute this `a.out` file.
