## Getting started

### Installing the Scheme compiler

* Windows: You can install [mit-scheme](http://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/) using a pre-built binary.
* Linux: You can install mit-scheme with your package manager - `apt-get install mit-scheme` or similar.
* Mac OS: You can install mit-scheme using Homebrew - `brew install mit-scheme`

### Building and running Scheme code
You can write your code in the editor of your choice. To run it, simply run it on a terminal in Windows, MacOS or Linux `scheme --load hello-world.scm`.

Congrats! You have just run your first Scheme code! :smile:
